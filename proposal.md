The goal for my makeutility project is to allow easy accessibility to gifs when using the Slack app.
Instead of having to look up a gif to copy and paste from the internet, a user can @ the bot and type in text, receiving a random gif that best relates to the input text. The bot looks for the closest matching gif to the text the user inputs, so there is room for improvement in terms of gif search capabilities...
